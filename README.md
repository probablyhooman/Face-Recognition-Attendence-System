# Facial Recognition Attendance System
This is a facial recognition attendance system built using OpenCV and face recognition libraries. The system is designed to recognize faces and record attendance automatically.

## Requirements
`Python 3.6 or Higher`

`OpenCV 4.0 or Higher`

`Face_recognition library`

`Numpy library`

`Pandas library`

## Installation 
- Install `Python 3.6 or Higher` on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: [Python Downlaod](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Install the OpenCV library by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt: `pip install opencv-python`
- Install the face-recognition library by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt: `pip install face_recognition`
- Install the NumPy library by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt: `pip install numpy`
- Install the Pandas library by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt: `pip install pandas`

## Usage
- Clone or download the project files from this GitHub repository.
- Open the `face_reco.ipynb` file in your text editor.
-  Run the `face_reco.ipynb` file.
-  The program will capture video from your webcam and attempt to recognize faces in the video stream. If a recognized face matches then the program will mark that person as present in the attendance sheet.
-  The attendance sheet will be saved as a CSV file named `attendance.csv` in the project directory.
